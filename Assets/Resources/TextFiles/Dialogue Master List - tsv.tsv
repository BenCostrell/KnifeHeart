Fireball	Lunge		I know it's harsh...	I know it might be hard to hear everyone say such mean things about you, which is why I wanted to tell you first.				
Fireball	Wallop		Relax.	Don't worry though, no one listens to what they say...probably.				
Fireball	Sing		As for me...	Don't you want to know what I would do about this?				
Fireball	Pull	Shield	I wouldn't say that.	You KNOW I would never say such things...				
Fireball	Pull	Lunge	Actions, not words.	I would have PROVED these things...				
Fireball	Pull	Wallop	Above it all.	In fact, I consider myself to be above such simple things.				
Fireball	Pull	Sing	If it were me...	If I had started this rumor it would have been about your terrible fashion sense.

Fireball	Wallop	Pull	People listen to me.	But they listen to what *I* say...so keep that in mind.				
Fireball	Wallop	Shield	It doesn't matter to me.	I don't care what you do though...as long as you know it's not my fault.				
Fireball	Wallop	Lunge	They could be right.	Who knows...maybe the rumors are right.

Sing	Lunge	Shield	If you don't want my help...	It's okay if you don't want my help...not everyone has it in them to be this spectacular.				
Sing	Lunge	Wallop	None of my business.	But of course...it's none of MY business if you want to continue looking like a disaster.				
Sing	Lunge	Fireball	Not even in my league.	It's so unfair that everyone compares you to me when you clearly don't come close...				
Sing	Wallop	Pull	Me > You.	They say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery...but your attempt to copy me has obviously failed.				
Sing	Wallop	Shield	Don't you appreciate me?	You never say anything nice to me though...why is that?				
Sing	Wallop	Lunge	Wish you could relate.	I'm sorry you don't know what it feels like to be so admired...				
Sing	Wallop	Fireball	They say I'm better than you.	There must be a reason people prefer me over you...				
Sing	Fireball	Pull	Impress me, impress others.	If only you could impress me...maybe then you would have a chance at winning others over.				
Sing	Fireball	Shield	Not using my advice?	It's refreshing to see someone brave enough to ignore all my advice.				
Sing	Fireball	Lunge	Lost cause...	I don't even think *I* could help you...				
Sing	Fireball	Wallop	I'm still better.	It's fine that you don't seem to care what people think...we all know you'll never be better than me.

Shield 		Pull		Wallop		Here comes the weasel!		No one appreciates my humor or style. But with everything I do, one day people will recognize the greatness in me. It's Pauly Shore all over again.  
Shield 		Sing		Pull		You haven't see my final form.		My therapist says a lot of stupid things, things that try to hurt me, but she has no idea that I'm untouchable, that I'm beyond her, that I'm almost...a god. Feel my power.
Shield 		Sing		Fireball		I'm not that mean.		My therapist also says I need to tell you that you're never going to amount to anything in life. She can be so mean.
Shield 		Sing		Lunge		Fist meet face.		I know I'm an angry person. And right now, that anger is telling me that you're the reason everything in my life is terrible. So like, I'm gonna beat you up now.

Shield 		Fireball		Sing		I scrapbook y'know.		And I definitely wouldn't be putting together this scrapbook of all your worst hairstyles that will then be distrbuted to the entire senior class. Or hit you with the scrapbook. Never.
Shield 		Fireball		Pull		I'm so charitable.		Of course I'm your best friend! I'm willing to let you hold my books without spitting on you. That's called charity.
Shield 		Fireball		Lunge		You have work to do.		I mean, I DO think you're hair could use some work. And your clothes. Your posture. Your face. Your voice. See how nice I am to not to tell you though?
Shield 		Fireball		Wallop		I can help with that face.		I'm not clowning around. You look like Bozo. I'm trying to help. Here let me wipe that off your face.
Shield 		Lunge		Sing		I'm the prettiest.		I mean, nobody is allowed to be as pretty as me. So I really need to punch your teeth in.
Shield 		Lunge		Pull		I'm going to MAKE you laugh.		Hey, I've got a joke, my fist is gonna tell it to your face. I can't wait till you hear the PUNCHline.
Shield 		Lunge		Fireball		Bald looks good!		I can always pull out your hair, because if you cut back on the makeup and hair products, you might be able to KEEP your friends.
Shield 		Lunge		Wallop		I'm too good for Yelp.		I very maturely and straightforwardly left you anonymous comments online. You can thank me later for the clothing advice.

Shield 		Wallop		Fireball		I voted for you!		I voted for you for the yearbook! Most likely to die alone and consumed by loneliness and a growing dependence on alcohol! You're welcome.
Shield 		Wallop		Lunge		Clean your face.		Ugh, get away from me. I swear if I wanted to fry some food, I'd get the grease off your forehead.
